ISSUES
------
- Doesn't name solution file correctly when supplied name has dots in it. eg. My.New.Solution get's named My.sln

- Test project Nuget package restore not working properly.  Package restores ok but dll reference path not updated.  (in visual studio only - works fine if runnning .\build in the command line)
